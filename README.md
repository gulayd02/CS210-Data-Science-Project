## Hypothesis
There is a correlation between the diversity of my Spotify playlist, encompassing both popular and emerging artists, and various factors such as music preferences, happiness, and daily routines, including peak listening times, lecture hours, and sleep patterns.

## Motivation
In this data science project, I wanted to understand and analyze my music listening habits on Spotify. I wanted to find out if I was more drawn to well-known songs or if my tastes lean more towards niche music and lesser-known artists. Exploring the patterns in my music preferences and understanding my favourite genres became a personal journey to discover my musical taste.

## Data Source
The primary data source for this project is my personal Spotify account. The data was collected directly from the Spotify API, which provides comprehensive details about my listening history, including song titles, artists, genres, and timestamps.

## Data Analysis
The analysis was carried out in several steps, using a combination of techniques to draw meaningful conclusions. First, the data was cleaned and pre-processed to ensure the accuracy of the information. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were then used to uncover patterns, trends and statistical distributions in my music listening data. Complementing this, web scraping techniques were used to gain external insights into the popularity and trends of the songs and artists in my playlist. Visualization techniques such as line charts, heatmaps and interactive graphs were used to present the findings in an easy-to-understand format.

## Findings
1. Popularity vs. Personal Taste: Contrary to my expectations, I found that the popularity of mainstream songs did not dominate my playlist. Instead, a wide range of tracks by popular and up-and-coming artists made up a significant proportion.
2. Favourite Genres and Relations with Hapiness: I conducted a genre analysis to determine the music genres that appealed to me the most. The genres identified in the analysis are closely related, showcasing the proximity and similarity in my musical preferences.
3. Listening Patterns: Examining the timestamp data revealed interesting patterns in my listening habits, such as peak times of music consumption and recurring trends on certain days. Analyzing the data alongside my lecture hours and sleep times revealed connections between my music preferences and daily routine. These insights help us understand how my academic commitments, sleep patterns, and music enjoyment interact.

## Limitations & Future Work
1. Completeness of Data: While the Spotify API provides a wealth of information, the completeness of the data can be limited, especially if certain songs or artists are not available on the platform. Future improvements could include the integration of data from multiple sources to increase completeness.
2. External Factors: The analysis focuses on internal patterns within the data. Future work could investigate external factors that influence music selection, such as mood, location, or social context.
3. User Interaction: Improvements to the site could be to incorporate user interaction features that allow others to explore their own Spotify data and compare patterns to encourage a more engaging and interactive experience.
